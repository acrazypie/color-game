## 🚀 Features

- Responsive design so you can play on desktop or mobile  

## 🧩 Tech Stack  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (with simple styling)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)  
- No frameworks or libraries required  

## ⚒️ Play Locally  
### Prerequisites  
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
- Internet connection only if you’re loading external assets (optional)  

### Installation / Running Locally  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/acrazypie/color-game.git
   ```  
2. Navigate into the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd color-game
   ```  
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.  

That’s it! The game will load and you can start playing.  

### Optional: Serve via local HTTP (to avoid any browser restrictions)  
If you’d like to serve the game via a local web server (helpful for testing), you can use a tool like [http‑server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server):  
```bash
npm install ‑g http‑server  
http‑server .  
```  
Then open `http://localhost:8080/index.html` in your browser.
